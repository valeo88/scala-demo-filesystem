# Demo filesystem project for "Scala for beginners" course

In this small project was implemented in-memory filesystem with directories and files.
Supported command:
- **cat** (only files in working directory)
- **cd** (with relative paths)
- **echo** (with >, >> operators to file output)
- **ls** (only in working directory)
- **mkdir** (only in working directory)
- **touch** (only in working directory)
- **rm** (with relative paths)
All operations running through the console. 
Sometimes I use more functional approach than in this original project.
